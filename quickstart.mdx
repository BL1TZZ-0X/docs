## Local Trade

If you need maximum security and control over your transactions, you can use ourÂ [Local Trade API](https://pumpportal.fun/local-trading-api/trading-api). The Local Trade API builds an unsigned base64 transaction that you have to Sign and then send with your own RPC node.

## Blitzz Mode

If you want maximum speed in landing your transaction, you can use our [Blitzz API](https://blitzz.fun/#blitzz-mode-endpoint). You just query the endpoint with your private key and our backend takes care of building, signing and sending the tx. Your transaction is safely handled and sent to our dedicated nodes for the fastest transaction landing times.

## Self Host

You can also self host Blitzz API on your own infrastructure for maximum speed and control. Pre built binaries are present on the Github repo here. h
